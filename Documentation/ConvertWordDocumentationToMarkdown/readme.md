#The basConvertDocToMarkdown module...
This is an attempt to export a simple word document to a markdown file, 
#Export as HTML instead...
As markdown accepts basic HTML exporting the word file as an html file then stripping the header portion works well enough as an alternative.
#Or Use the Ruby Converter...
