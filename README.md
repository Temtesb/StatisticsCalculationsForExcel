2. Create or move a excel or access file into either the root or a existing 'build' directory of the project
3. Manually import the build_ImportExport.bas module and run the 'ToolImportModules' subroutine (shortcut keys{alt+f11; ctl+g})
4. Once the code is loaded you can save, close and move your file.

## History

This project began as a way to build vba functions to better analyze data using the tools that are avialable to us in our work lives. The initial functions where built during a Managing Small Business Data Analytics class at [Regent University](www.regent.edu/). Those functions that are mentioned as being derived from the course text of 'Essentials of Business Analytics ISBN 978-1-305-62773-4' are all found in the [/Excel/Src/basStatsistics.bas](Excel/src/basStatistics.bas) file or [/General VB/Src/VB_Statsistics.bas](/General VB/Src/VB_Statsistics.bas) file.
